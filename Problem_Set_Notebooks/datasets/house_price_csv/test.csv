12313708,Foxrock,3.0,5.0,C3,Dublin,"The Apple House is a superb contemporary home designed by RKD Architects with emphasis placed on space and light creating this secluded, spacious family home extending to approximately 300 sqm/3,229 sqft.

The Apple House, as its name suggests, was built c.2000 on the site of an old summer house with sea views later used as a store for apples of a neighbouring house on Brennanstown Road. The excellent design of this house was ahead of its time and captures the spirit of its setting with the essence of the space to perfection. On entering this inviting home, standing proud on an elevated site, you are immediately impressed by its unique design. A delightful mix of building materials to include self-coloured render, Canadian redwood cedar cladding, granite stone and glazed walls are married together to perfection. The bright accommodation enjoys an excellent flow and opens up, at every opportunity, with doors leading to the garden creating a seamless connection blurring the boundaries with the inside and the outside. This is without doubt a comfortable family home which provides for a relaxed family lifestyle within an open, natural layout enjoying an excellent flow of accommodation that is both comfortable and sophisticated at the same time. 

A raised wooden platform with glazed panelling is approached by a number of steps and opens into the hallway. The hallway sets the design tone boasting a double height glazed atrium, a curved wall providing under-stairs storage complemented by a curved stairwell with travertine steps leading to the first floor. From here a set of French doors leads to the deck to the rear which hugs the back of the house where your attention is immediately drawn to the outside. To the left double doors open to the magnificent living room with wide, statement steps reaching down to the living area. This dual aspect room has French doors and a picture floor to ceiling window from here to the garden. To the other side of the sandstone fireplace is another picture window, partly frosted for privacy, providing views of Killiney Hill. There is an inner hall with glazed wall which leads to the open-plan kitchen cum dining room area. Along the corridor there is located the guest wc and boot room. The kitchen is aesthetically designed to blend into the dining area with floor mounted walnut presses and a centre island. Both topped with a granite worktop in muted brown and natural shades. There is a prep sink as well as full sink. There is an AGA with tempered glass splashback. The AGA is gas fired and features a 4 plate gas hob. The kitchen opens up into the bright dining / living area with glazed walls on both sides and access to the patio garden to the side of the house providing shelter and the perfect barbeque area. There is a simple, fireplace with sleek black granite hearth and double doors leading to the family room. The family room is completely glazed to the back with French doors leading to the decking area which cleverly, and no doubt by design, connects to the living room at the other side of the house. The utility room is particularly spacious and is plumbed for a dishwasher, washing machine and tumble dryer. There is a corridor with plenty of storage presses and access to the side garden.

The first floor is approached by sweeping travertine staircase which opens to a galleried landing looking down on the hall with glazed floor to ceiling wall reflecting plenty of light from a south facing orientation. To the eastern side of the house there are two bedrooms both with built-in wardrobes and a separate shower room. On the other side of the stairwell is the family bathroom, with bath, whb, wc and separate shower. There is a third and fourth bedroom along the impressive glazed landing and a door to the main bedroom suite. The main suite enjoys a tri-aspect room with commanding views of the garden. It has a separate walk-in wardrobe and shower room located behind the bedroom. It is particularly bright and airy with a dramatic vaulted ceiling and further complemented by French doors to a sun terrace (approx. 5.0 x 5.0). The main suite enjoys privacy and seclusion creating its own relaxation zone whilst still retaining connectivity to the rest of the house. 
This is without doubt a superb family home with tastefully applied design touches using honed Portuguese limestone, maple, sandstone and natural materials blended to create a home that delivers modern comfort and luxury in an impressively thoughtful and considered design where the indoor space blends seamlessly with its surrounds.

OUTSIDE:
The Apple House sits proud on an elevated site of 0.25 acres. Approached via a gravelled driveway to the front which provides parking for several cars. Two distinctive leylandii pompom trees rest under the eaves of the house at the front followed by the entrance raised deck with glazed sides. 
The garden to the front is a combination of mature shrubs to the boundary of the site providing privacy and shelter and a large gravelled parking apron. There is also a large barna shed for storage. To the side of the house is a gravelled patio area enjoying a westerly orientation the perfect site for evening barbeques and al fresco dining. The rear garden is laid out mainly in lawn and enjoys a south facing orientation with a leafy outlook over mature trees forming the boundary at the back. A large south facing sun deck to the rear provides a generous area for leisurely seating. A flower bed with gunnera plants (giant-rhubarb) provides an impressive backdrop to the large south facing decking area which connects the two wings of the house creating a delightful leisurely seating area.

--APPROX. 97 SQ.M/1044 SQ. FT OF ATTIC SPACE DESIGNED FOR CONVERSION (SPP)---
Set on c.0.3 acres of gardens, and on one of Foxrock's most desirable roads, Curraheen is a beautiful detached family home with tremendous potential to extend and remodel. 
Discreetly tucked away and approached through electric gates, a charming tree-lined gravel driveway leads to Curraheen and its beautiful grounds. There you will find a great sense of space, tranquility and privacy. The sunny and secluded gardens are beautifully maintained with lawns, well-stocked planted borders and paved patio areas, perfect for al fresco dining.
The accommodation comprises of a large reception hall, living/dining measuring 7.27m x 4.14m with patio doors leading to the gardens, a family room, study/home office, kitchen, utility room, family bathroom, a most generous master bedroom with en suite bathroom and two further bedrooms.
The attic is a particular feature. When Curraheen was built in 1995, the attic was designed and constructed with future conversion (subject to planning) in mind. The space is extensive. At approximately 97 sq.m/1044 sq.ft and with over 2.4 meters of head height for a lot of the area, it would be easy to envisage how this space would convert into extra bedrooms and bathroom accommodation. In addition, given its generous site area, there is obvious further potential to extend at ground floor level.
Located off Torquay Road, Golf Lane is a quiet, leafy cul-de-sac road, leading to Foxrock Golf Club and is a short walk to Foxrock Village.
The area boasts a wide range of amenities on its doorstep. From the local restaurants, cafes, shops, and boutiques of Foxrock Village to the vast choice at Cornelscourt, Dundrum Town Centre, Sandyford, Blackrock, and Stillorgan, all within easy reach.
For the sports enthusiasts, Curraheen is close to two Golf Clubs, the Carrickmines Tennis Club, a number of GAA, Athletic and Hockey Clubs, and Dun Laoghaire Harbour where several yacht and sailing clubs are within a short drive. Some of Dublin's finest schools are in the area. St. Brigid's and Holly Park national schools, Loreto College in Foxrock, Holy Child in Killiney, Mount Anville Goatstown, and Blackrock College, and St. Andrews College are all close by. UCD is also easily accessible on the N11 bus route.
Transport links are excellent. The N11 and the M50 are minutes away, and there is a good choice of public transport with the LUAS Greenline stopping at Carrickmines and Sandyford and frequent bus services to the city and neighboring suburbs within a short walk.

Located in one of Dublins most prestigious and affluent suburbs is this redbrick Victorian property.  Number 25 Northbrook Road is set over three floors.  The new owner will have the privilege to make some extremely exciting decisions about the room layouts and their use to transform and update this vast property into a home for today with the benefit of beautiful and elegant features from the past.  

The property boasts a coveted location on leafy Northbrook Road in Ranelagh.  When exploring the area you cannot but notice the number of refurbishment projects currently in progress to transform these highly sought after properties for use as spacious and prestigious single family homes.  

It presents wonderful potential for an impressive family home with considerable living and entertaining space over the upper &amp; lower ground levels and an opportunity for four large bedrooms upstairs, which at present is divided into a number of smaller rooms due to the property€TM past use as a home for Nurses.   

The front of the property is bordered by the original wrought iron railings and pedestrian gate and a flight of bullnose granite steps lead to a covered porch area which boats the original decorative columns and original ornate floor tiles.  The house is accessed on the raised ground floor and upon entering the grand entrance hall you will immediately notice the incredible amount of character befitting to the Victorian era that this property has to offer.  

In addition to the original house, there is an Annex to the rear, which was added to the property in 1973.  The Annex comprises of smaller rooms and bedrooms and may not suit the vision of all Purchasers, some of which may wish to modify this or replace it with a more practical contemporary extension.

There is decorative brick work to the front exterior and the original ceiling roses and cornicing are still intact throughout.  The original sash windows are in place throughout the property, as are the window shutters.  Another prominent feature in this property is the marble and cast iron fireplaces.  

On the raised ground floor entrance level is the Drawing Room with its grand marble fireplace and large window that looks out to the rear.  There is also a Parlour with cast iron fireplace which also looks out to the rear of the property.  There is a bright Dining Room to the front with two large sash windows overlooking Northbrook Road.  There is also a further marble fireplace in this room and the original dumbwaiter.  To the rear of the raised ground floor you step down to a return area with study, door to external balcony &amp; steps leading to the rear garden, access to the Annex and the main stairway which lead down to the basement level.

In the basement is the Kitchen with Aga, which heats the water for the ground &amp; first floors.  Off this Kitchen is a Laundry Room and Utility Room with access to the external stairs Undercroft; ideal for storage.  The original Pantry is still intact, which really shows off the rich character and history of the property.  There is also a smaller Room and access to the side of the house.  To the rear of the basement are three further Rooms, a shower room and a further external door to the side of the house &amp; boiler house.  The basement area of the rear Annex is not accessible via the basement level of the main house.

The side of the house and garden are accessed via the basement level.  The garden is surrounded by an attractive original stone wall and to the rear is a gate for pedestrian access via the mews lane behind, giving the property potential for vehicular access and private parking to the rear, which some neighbouring properties have already taken advantage of.  At present the garden is consumed by the Annex, however it has potential for a much larger space even if a contemporary extension was added, again as a neighbouring property has proven.

On the first floor of the main house there is a spacious gallery style Landing and potential for four generous Bedrooms.  At the moment, two of the main Bedrooms are divided into smaller rooms by removable stud partitions.

The exterior red brick faé§ade sets the tone of what lies behind with many original features throughout the property.

Measuring an impressive 450sq.m/4,843sq.ft approx., the internal accommodation offers well-proportioned bedrooms and living areas. The orientation allows for natural light to flood the property through the large viewing windows, further enhanced by the high ceilings. The basement level is currently sectioned off from the main residence and set out as two apartments. It is possible to reinstate this section back into the main home if one desires, but also could serve as an added income as a rental or accommodation for an au pair and/or grandparent.

Many completed new homes will boast fashionable interiors however having the ability to develop a property to your own taste means you end up with the house 'made for you'. 

As the opportunity to acquire mews sites in Dublin 4 is now very rare, some may consider refining the approved planning for the mews site and submitting a fresh application. The choice is yours.

12315466,Rathmines,2.0,4.0,,Dublin,"18 Windsor Road is an inviting 4-bedroom Victorian home positioned on the much-coveted southerly side of this premier road.

Purchased in 1993 by the current owners, the then-condition of No.18 was a very poor state of repair. A sensitive refurbishment and renovation was undertaken with a focus on restoration and modernisation, taking care to preserve its Victorian charm, whilst incorporating modern-day comforts. 

This classical Victorian home is both traditional and contemporary with their family now grown the current owners have configured the accommodation to suit their needs. A welcoming hallway with guest w.c., living room and large open plan kitchen/breakfast/dining room with study off comprise the downstairs accommodation. A cleverly conceived and positioned utility room is located just outside the garden patio doors, offering extra storage. Upstairs are no less than 4 double bedrooms served by a family bathroom. The main bedroom spanning the full width of this property is resplendent as an elegant drawing room. New owners will choose their own layout and configuration, without the need for structural change. 

Also of significant merit is the landscaped, southerly rear garden. Sizeable, private and wonderfully mature, this is a place for the entire family dine and relax al fresco, kick a ball or for those of you green-fingered, enjoy many hours tending to the flowering plants, shrubs and lawn. 

Those discerning buyers looking for a beautiful family home, indeed those looking to downsize need look no further.

The rear garden is one of the largest on the road and backs on to both the Tennis and GAA Clubs. There is also a water feature with small stone bridge which adds greatly to the property s character.

The entrance hall is finished with tasteful wood panelling and accommodation is generous with two formal reception rooms and a kitchen located off the hallway.

Extending to 145sq.m / 1,561sq.ft, No. 26 Frankfort Park has an enviable setting, situated in the quietest part of the sought after cul de sac that is Frankfort Park. This fine late Edwardian family home was built in 1934 when the surrounding area was just fields and the middle classes escaped the run down city centre for the cleaner and healthier air of the suburbs. It retains many attractive period features and throughout, the property benefits from generous proportions and there is a wonderful quality of light, due in large part to its ideal south westerly aspect. The property has been in the same family for over 60 years, which is a true testament of its quality and location. If you are looking for 'the good life' then look no further than this wonderful home, based in the garden suburbs of 1930's Britain.

Outside to the rear, a long private and mature garden is laid out in a pleasant combination of sun terrace, lawn and mature planted beds.  At the end of the garden is a vegetable plot ready for a keen green-fingered enthusiast to grow an abundance of organic vegetables for the dinner table, and there is a wonderful old apple tree, planted when the house was built, which provides wonderfully flavorsome apples in season.  There is access to the front via the Utility Room or Store. The front garden is railed and walled with cast iron gates and landscaped to provide parking for two cars.

A sliding door leads out to the garden and a further door links through to the kitchen/breakfast with extensive, fitted shaker style units. A pantry area off the kitchen leads out to the garden. There is also a study / bedroom five with en-suite at this level. Upstairs there are four very generously appointed bedrooms, three of which are doubles. A bathroom completes the accommodation at this level. 

To the front of the property there is a graveled driveway with a granite path bordered by well stocked beds. A very wide side passage leads to the rear of the house where there is a patio ideal for alfresco dining, a large lawn and a further patio at the end of the garden. Mainly laid in lawn, it is bordered by a profusion of plants, shrubs and trees. Impressively large at first glance, it also benefits from extra width beyond the raised beds and trees. The impressive length of the garden (110ft.) offers the discerning purchaser great potential to extend the property (subject to planning permission) and perhaps even develop a separate unit at the end of the garden (subject to planning permission). There is also a boiler house, storage shed and oil tank shed in the garden. The property is situated within easy reach of a host of amenities both social and essential. Blackrock, Monkstown, Dun Laoghaire, Deansgrange and Killiney Shopping Centre provide excellent local shopping while Dundrum Shopping Centre and Carrickmines retail park are easily reached, not to mention the N11, QBC and M50. Schools and other educational facilities are well catered for with Rathdown, Monkstown Educate Together, CBC Monkstown, St Joseph of Cluny and IADT are within easy reach along with being on the main bus route to UCD. 

All in all this is an excellent property and early viewing is highly recommended.
